## 6/14/2021 - VESC Basic Setup 
VESC - (Benjamin **V**edder's) **E**lectric **S**peed **C**ontroller

### Components
- DC/AC power converter (?)
> DC AC power conversion is done by overlapping multiple DC sources to 'create' and effective sinusoid power. By activating different DC sources at different time intervals, a staircase like waveform can be created.

- MCU controller (STM32)
> STM32? Runs an RTOS system? TBD
- Motor (QWinOut A2212 1000kV Brushless Outrunner Motor)
> "Outrunner Motors" are a type of frameless torque motor- essentially a watered down version of a typical servomotor, which would contain a frame, housing, etc., and replaces all that with 2 main components: a stator (essentially a series of toroids that creates torque from electric charge) and rotor that carries the magnets. Because of the geometry, these types of motors can generate very high amounts of torque, but less RPM than conventional motors. They are ideal for small volume builds and situations where a seperate system can optimize the motor for a specific purpose- such as a VESC device.

- Battery (Duracell 12V 7AH Battery) 
- USB connecter/powerline
- VESC Tool
> The VESC Tool is an opensource software used to configure VESC hardware and firmware- along with many other functions.

### Setup
1. Connect the 3-phase power from the DC/AC power converter to the motor
2. Connect the DC input to the DC battery/powersource

3. Obtain and install a working copy of the VESC Tool   
    Direct Download:  https://vesc-project.com/vesc_tool   
    Github:           https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool
4. Connect the MCU controller/power converter to computer using USB powerline. Power on DC source.
5. Use the autoconnect wizard on VESC tool. Update firmware if prompted, and reconnect if updated.
6. Use Motor setup  
    Size depends on motor weight (small)  
    Battery depends on connected source (Lead Acid, 1 cell series, 7 AH)  
    VESC tool will automatically configure motors connected to the VESC board
8. Test input using the VESC Tools in the bottom left.

    Anchor = Break  
    D = Duty  
    I = current  
    w = RPM  
    p = angle  
    We can alter input to take in keyboard or controller commands (arrow keys) using options along the right side
    
## 6/15/2021 - VESC Tool Install
Install VESC Tool using the github source

### Steps
- Tried doing it on windows, this seems doomed  
    Guide (?) to doing it on windows: https://vesc-project.com/node/1057  
    Install on a linx VM, then cross compile to windows  
- Create Ubuntu VM using Oracle VM  
- Followed: https://vesc-project.com/node/310 to install
    Replace sudo apt install qt-sdk with libqt4-dev
- Need to download older version of Qt Creator  
    https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.1/5.1.0/
