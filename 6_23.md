- Git Bash (needed to clone git repo to your computer) (https://git-scm.com/download/win)

### Steps
- Download/Install Qt Creator, Qt, and Git Bash --> may be some download issues with Qt
> Qt creator is the GUI used to build and edit the .pro files, but needs a version of Qt to actually configure the  
VESC-tool project.  
Qt is quite a large download...  don't use the berkeley mirror, bad download (http://qt.mirror.constant.com/archive/qt/5.12/5.12.11/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.12.11.exe)
- Clone repository using Git bash  (git clone https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool.git)
- Theoretically, from here you should be able to run the vesc_tool.pro file from Qt Creator after configuring, but there may be some other issues.
