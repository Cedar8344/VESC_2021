## 7/2/2021 - LED Editing
### Goal: Be able to change the VESC's native LED lights from the VESC tool terminal

Three main files in veddeb/bldc
- ledpwm.c - nothing to edit here, but will need to be added to terminal.c so it can access the relevant LED functions
- terminal.c - here create new custom commands that can be accessed from the VESC tool terminal.
- main.c - will need to disable the fault_check LED blink functions, as they will set the red led to off (intensity = 0.0) at every cycle.

Code:
//inserted code
	}else if(strcmp(argv[0], "maplestory") == 0) {
		commands_printf("firmware upload worked");
//Turn red led on
	}else if(strcmp(argv[0], "lighton") == 0) {
		commands_printf("Turn on red LED\n");
    ledpwm_set_intensity(LED_RED, 1.0);
		ledpwm_led_on(LED_RED);
//Turn red led off
	}else if(strcmp(argv[0], "lightoff") == 0) {
		commands_printf("Turn off red LED\n");
    =ledpwm_set_intensity(LED_RED, 0.0);
		ledpwm_led_off(LED_RED);
//blink red led
	}else if (strcmp(argv[0], "blinkred") == 0) {
		commands_printf("Blink red led 10 times\n");
		for (int i = 0;i < 10 ;i++) {
        ledpwm_set_intensity(LED_RED, 1.0);
        chThdSleepMilliseconds(250);
        ledpwm_set_intensity(LED_RED, 0.0);
        chThdSleepMilliseconds(250);
   } //and the rest of the elseif statements
